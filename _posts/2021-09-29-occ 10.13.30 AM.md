# When will OCC be a win?

P(failure) x restart_cost < AVG(Locking delay per query)

Essentially boils down to P(failure).

Advantages:

- No lock overhead.
- No deadlocks.

Disadvantage:

- Lock cost becomes restart cost.
- May "starve". Abort repeatedly.

#  How does OCC work?

tbegin > read phase > tend > validation phase > write phase

##  Read Phase

Such an unfortunate naming! It does midlead me from time to time. There **are** writes (and a lot) in read phase.

My Definition: A transaction does "temporary" work in read phase.

Because there's no lock, transactions **write** into copies of objects during the **read** phase. Only after passing validation can the copies come into effect. (Isolation)

##  Validation Phase

###  Assigning transaction numbers (tn)

Validation must have a ground - that is, the order of transactions. 

How to determine the order? 

Principle (spoiler): We need to know the **write set** (which is constructed during the **read phase**) of **all** previous (in terms of tn) txns **before we can enter our validation phase**.

- Should assign tn after this txn comes into existence.
- Should assign tn before validation phase starts: or we enter validation phase w/o a tn. Sad!
- Two choices: at the start/end of read phase
  - At the start: Remember the principle above, which means we have to **wait** for all previous txns to finish their read phases.
  - At the end: we don't have to wait since we are sure that all previous txns have finished their read phases.

###  Requirements to pass the validation phase

One of the following three:
