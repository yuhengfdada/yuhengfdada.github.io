# 怎么设置ET

在register event的时候，在event中传入`EPOLLET` flag就行了。

# LT和ET是啥

它们唯一的区别就是“通知方式”不同。

以readable为例：

LT：只要某fd在readable状态，就会一直提醒（指epoll_wait()马上返回）。

ET：只在某fd**从unreadable状态变为readable状态**时epoll_wait()才会返回。

# 来个具体的例子

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoll

For instance, if a [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe) registered with `epoll` has received data, a call to `epoll_wait` will return, signaling the presence of data to be read. Suppose, the reader only consumed **part of** data from the buffer. In level-triggered mode, further calls to `epoll_wait` will return immediately, as long as the pipe's buffer contains data to be read. In edge-triggered mode, however, `epoll_wait` will return only once new data is written to the pipe.

# 但是为啥叫LT/ET?

有点数字电路内味了。

LT就是：只要fd的状态一直在readable的**level**，那就一直触发提醒。

ET就是：只有在fd的状态从 unreadable 到 readable 的那条**edge**上才会触发提醒。

# 什么时候应该用ET

简单来说就是：有时候我们不想马上处理一个read。所以LT别老在那烦我。

>When an FD becomes read or write ready, you might not necessarily want to read (or write) all the data immediately.

Level-triggered epoll will keep nagging you as long as the FD remains ready, whereas edge-triggered won't bother you again until the next time you get an `EAGAIN` (so it's more complicated to code around, but can be more efficient depending on what you need to do).
>
Say you're writing from a resource to an FD. If you register your interest for that FD becoming write ready as level-triggered, you'll get constant notification that the FD is still ready for writing. If the resource isn't yet available, that's a waste of a wake-up, because you can't write any more anyway.
>
If you were to add it as edge-triggered instead, you'd get notification that the FD was write ready once, then when the other resource becomes ready you write as much as you can. Then if `write(2)` returns `EAGAIN`, you stop writing and wait for the next notification.
>
The same applies for reading, because you might not want to pull all the data into user-space before you're ready to do whatever you want to do with it (thus having to buffer it, etc etc). With edge-triggered epoll you get told when it's ready to read, and then can remember that and do the actual reading "as and when".

还有一个场景，就是多线程环境中，事件到来时只想唤醒一个线程，可以用ET。LT可能唤醒多个线程处理一个事件，拉了。

> ET is also particularly nice with a multithreaded server on a multicore machine. You can run one thread per core and have all of them call epoll_wait on the same epfd. When data comes in on an fd, exactly one thread will be woken to handle it.
